# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website.

The site is intentionally built as a **simple static HTML page**, focused on clarity, storytelling, and long-term maintainability rather than visual effects or heavy frameworks.

## About Me

I started my career as a **Software Engineer**, building backend systems and shipping product features.

As the company grew, data became increasingly important — and increasingly unreliable.  
Metrics were unclear, data sources were fragmented, and numbers could not be trusted.

That was when I transitioned into a **Data Engineer**.

I became the first data engineer in the team and built the data system from zero:
- discovering existing data sources,
- cleaning and validating messy data,
- designing data pipelines and models,
- and enabling teams to make decisions based on trustworthy metrics.

This portfolio is a short summary of that journey — from writing code that works, to building systems that last.

## What This Portfolio Is (and Is Not)

**This portfolio is:**
- A narrative of how I think about engineering systems
- A reflection of real-world experience and trade-offs
- A place to share selected work, writing, and ideas

**This portfolio is not:**
- A flashy landing page
- A frontend showcase
- A list of tools without context

## Tech Stack

The website is deliberately kept simple.

- **HTML5**
- **CSS (minimal, inline styles)**
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

No frameworks.  
No JavaScript.  
No build step.

This choice reflects how I approach engineering:
